    - [catdogimage](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/UoB6HaKEe/): following model was deployed through teachable machines/ml5.js



3 ways ml can be incorporated in our projects:

- pre-trained model (mobilenet, mobilenetv2, mobilenetv3)
- transfer learning ( using knowledge of one task to improve performance of another)
- custom models



## Basic ML Concepts:
Loss function: function used to calc loss value.
Loss value: way to determine margine of error from guess answer to actual answer, lesser the loss value more are we accurate.
