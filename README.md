    - [catdogimage](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/UoB6HaKEe/): following model was deployed through teachable machines/ml5.js
    - Neural Network
    - Transfer Learning
    - Pre Trained model
    - Rock paper scissor
      



3 ways ml can be incorporated in our projects:

- pre-trained model (mobilenet, mobilenetv2, mobilenetv3)
- transfer learning ( using knowledge of one task to improve performance of another)
- custom models ( own model from scratch)
  



## Basic ML Concepts:
- Loss function: function used to calc loss value.
- Loss value: way to determine margine of error from guess answer to actual answer, lesser the loss value more are we accurate.
- Epoch: one complete pass through the training dataset.
- Batch size: no of training examples used in one iteration.
